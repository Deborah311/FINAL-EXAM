 MY PROJECT NAME
Online Bookstore Inventory Management System
Problem Statement
Traditional bookstore operations often rely on manual inventory tracking, leading to data inconsistencies, stock mismanagement, 
and delays in order processing. These inefficiencies result in poor customer satisfaction, increased operational costs,
and the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

# PHASE 4: Database Creation 

A Pluggable Database (PDB) that allows multiple databases to be stored and managed within a single Container Database (CDB).
 
![PDBS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a4c7062-5df6-413c-88f8-7cf82b96f59a)

 User of PDB allows us to create tables. 
 
![USER](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/214949fb-6b1b-4dc4-99fc-8b689603647d)

This is when the user is given access to make modification in PDB

WINDOW FUNCTION  

A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing the result into a single row.

![Show how many of each book each customer has purchased in total](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea631e6b-a790-4ad2-8b8e-90ec472017ba)

PROCEDURE  

A procedure is a named block of code that performs a specific task, but does not return a value directly 

![test procedure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f7c1cc8-f431-4812-80a7-59c4bce06f34)

CURSOR

A cursor is a pointer to a result set of a query. It allows you to process query results row-by-row in PL/SQL.
 
![CURSOR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29dbf53d-6dde-4637-80e8-aeba4358f0df)

PACKAGE

A package in PL/SQL is a grouping of related procedures, functions, variables, cursors, and other PL/SQL elements stored together in the database.
